# Notes

This course was presented in a single day in 4 90 minute modules with a break between each module
and breaks in the middle of each module so that no more than ~45 minutes were presented at a single stint.

Certain sections are [REDACTED] due to company sensitivities. I don't believe it materially subtracts from
the value of this outline. If one were to adapt this content for a new instantiation, the sections could
be customized for local platforms, etc.
