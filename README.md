Getting Started in Data Science and Analytics - a one-day, 8 hr. short course

This is a one-day 8-hour short course in getting started in data science and analytics. It was originally presented to new employees (less than 3-years on board) at my company. Most of the students are scientists or engineers (Chemistry, Physics, Aerospace, Mechanical, etc.). The course is designed to provide a broad survey of data science and analytics topics geared toward getting work done at our office.
